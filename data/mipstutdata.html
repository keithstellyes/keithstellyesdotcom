<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>MIPS is a CPU architecture that has been used in various embedded systems
including a few things like the Game Boy Advance. It is a simple assembly
language to learn and is a good stepping stone if one wants to learn assembly
for other CPU architectures, such as those found in desktops/laptops.</p>
<p>This is a tutorial that aims to give a thorough walkthrough of usage.</p>
<h2 id="why-learn-assembly">Why learn assembly?</h2>
<p>Learning assembly is a must if one hopes to get a solid understanding of how
higher-level programming languages like C, or even Java or Python eventually
translate (<em>compile</em>) to actual instructions. In many ways however, knowing
this will help you better implement algorithms as you get used to thinking at
a more basic level.</p>
<p>Also, if you ever intend to use debugging software like gdb, or want to
reverse-engineer software, with things like Cheat Engine to hack videogames
(Just do it in single-player please ;) ) assembly is a must-know. Of course,
don't take me too literally here, as with things like Cheat Engine or gdb,
you'll be using a different architecture that will be a bit more complicated
than MIPS, but not too much. This is a good starting ground.</p>
<p>Of course, if you also wanna write a compiler, or otherwise wanna work
low-level for other reasons, MIPS is a good place to get your feet wet. But,
if this applies to you, I doubt you needed an explanation.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-difficult">Is it difficult?</h2>
<p>In a fundamental sense, one can learn <em>"theoretically"</em> learn assembly easier
than other programming languages, such as Python or C++. This is because it
is the most basic level of direction. But, here in the real world, assembly is
actually much more difficult to write software in, even trivial applications
can easily become a headache in assembly to the inexperienced and experienced
alike.</p>
<p>There's no OOP to learn, inheritance, lambdas, or anything like that. There is
a simplicity you may learn to appreciate. Of course, you'll also gain an
appreciation of many higher-level language features ;) I promise it's fun,
though.</p>
<h2 id="why-mips-assembly-and-not-another-architecture">Why MIPS Assembly and not another architecture?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>MIPS is a <em>RISC</em> architecture (Reduced Instruction Set), so learning the
basics is much simpler, and can focus on the actual programming. It is simpler
to learn than the arch used in standard desktops/laptops: x86-64.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementations of MIPS simulators (In particular, MARS) I've found to be
much simpler and easier to use than those for LLVM or LC3 or ARM. (Don't read
this as negativity about LLVM and LC3, those are very good projects with a lot
of smart people.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actually runs on native hardware. Unlike things like LC3.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-do-i-need-to-already-know">What do I need to already know?</h2>
<p>If you know any basic programming, you should be fine, if you know C or C++
you're golden. </p>
<h2 id="a-few-notes-before-you-start">A few notes before you start</h2>
<p>You will hear both <em>registers</em> and <em>memory</em> talked about. A register is a
memory unit that is directly "on" the CPU as opposed to RAM that we can perform
actions directly with. For your memory that isn't in one of your few registers,
you must load it from memory before you can do things like math, I/O, etc. If
this doesn't quite make sense, it should make sense as you go through this
tutorial and have a bit more context.</p>
<h1 id="part-1-hello-world">PART 1: Hello, World!</h1>
<h2 id="taking-the-plunge">Taking the plunge</h2>
<p>Let's get our very first Hello, World! program!</p>
<p>I'll just throw it at you, kind of examine it, then I'll explain it
line-by-line.</p>
<pre><code>.data

hello:  .asciiz "Hello, World!\n"

.text
    la $a0, hello
    li $v0, 4
    syscall
    li
    syscall
</code></pre>
<h2 id="explanation-line-by-line">Explanation line-by-line</h2>
<p>We'll need to declare a few places in memory for our data. Well, we only need
one place this time. The lines beginning with . are mainly for the assembler to
organize the parts of the program for us. A part for "variable declarations", a
part for our actual code, etc.   <code>.data</code> is for where we will pre-define
different variables in memory.</p>
<pre><code>.data
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we've marked where we're gonna store our data. Here, we declare a 
place in memory for a null-terminated string, <code>"Hello, World!\n"</code> the \n is
the newline character. The <code>hello:</code> is a label for this place in memory.</p>
<pre><code>hello:  .asciiz "Hello, World!\n"
</code></pre>
<p>Let's mark the section where we'll start making legitimate instructions.</p>
<pre><code>.text
</code></pre>
<p>Let's store our string into a register, we need to load the address of our
string into the<code>$a0</code> register. This is the register that the print service
takes its argument from. The instruction to do this is <code>la</code>. <code>la</code> means
"Load address", this loads the address we labelled hello into <code>$a0</code>.</p>
<pre><code>la $a0, hello
</code></pre>
<p>So now that we have our string in the register, ready to be used as an argument
for the print string service, we need to actually <em>specify</em> this service. A
table with all the different services and their numbers can be found 
<a href="http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/Help/SyscallHelp.html">here</a>.
The specific service that is executed is determined by the value in the
register <code>$v0</code>. The print string service is <code>4</code>. We have a specific
instruction that will set an exact value into this register, <code>li</code>, which is
"Load immediate". It is very similar to the instruction above. (In fact, they
can be interchangable in some cases, but it's not recommended to think of them
this way, for readability.) This instruction is when we have a specific value
in our code, usually a literal like below. Effectively, we are doing
<code>$v0 = 4</code>.</p>
<pre><code>li $v0, 4
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we've actually set the instruction, we need to actually use the
<code>syscall</code> instruction to use a system service. It'll check the arguments in
the various registers that the specific service, and execute accordingly. This
service we're using only takes an argument at <code>$v0</code> which shall contain the
address of our string.</p>
<pre><code>syscall
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we've printed "Hello, World!", we could theoretically just stop here. But,
the best practice in software is that we exit with an exit signal 0, exit
success. This will be a system service like last time, just making a call to
exit, marking a succesful run. This is like <code>return 0</code> in C. Most languages
automatically do this for you.</p>
<pre><code>li $v0, 10
</code></pre>
<p>And then now that we've specified our service, we make our system call, and we
are good.</p>
<pre><code>syscall
</code></pre>
<h2 id="source">Source</h2>
<p>Here's the source code with comments.</p>
<pre><code>.data

hello:  .asciiz "Hello, World!\n"

.text

    la $a0, hello  #argument to print str
    li $v0, 4      #print syscall
    syscall        #make syscall
    li $v0, 10     #exit syscall
    syscall        #tell OS to do the syscall
</code></pre>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>
<p><code>li</code> means "Load immediate" and <code>la</code> means "Load address". <code>li</code> is for
when we have a specific number, a literal as it is called in other languages,
to put into the spot in memory. Whereas <code>la</code> will load into it an address.</p>
<p>A typical program will declare a few spots in memory for variables pre-hand in
the <code>.data</code> section, and the actual instructions proper in <code>.text</code>.</p>
<p>Most I/O will be done with syscalls that take their arguments in specific
registers like <code>$a0</code>.</p>
<h1 id="part-2-ab">PART 2: A+B</h1>
<p>This will be a simple enough program. Get two integers, then print their sum.</p>
<h2 id="walking-through-it">Walking through it.</h2>
<p>First, we declare a spot in memory to store our integers, and for our 
strings to display when we want user input. <code>.word</code> refers to the amount of
data we can address at a time, this is the size of a spot in memory like a
register. This is a bit more of a complicated thing that I'm letting on, but
this is "good enough" for our purposes here. It is a 32 bit integer. 4 bytes.
Neat. And after that data declaration, we'll output to user telling them to
give us an integer.</p>
<pre><code>.data
    a:.word 0
    b:.word 0
    givea: .asciiz "A:"
    giveb: .asciiz "B:"

.text
    la $a0, givea #Load string
    li $v0, 4     #Set syscall to print string
    syscall
</code></pre>
<p>Let's read an integer from the user. To do that, we'll be doing another syscall
specifically, 5, and the result is returned in <code>$v0</code>.</p>
<pre><code>li $v0, 5    #read integer service. Integer returned in $v0
syscall
</code></pre>
<p>Let's go ahead and store the result into memory. Generally speaking, while
MARS MIPS implementation this isn't as necessary, registers can be a generally
risky spot to store data long-term, as function calls don't necessarily make a
guarantee to preserve them between calls, so for demonstration purposes, we 
store it at the spot in memory we allocated, at <code>a</code>. We'll be using the
instruction <code>sw</code> that stores the <code>word</code> in the first argument, which is a
register, into the second argument, a place in memory.</p>
<pre><code>sw $v0, a
</code></pre>
<p>Let's do the same process, but for <code>b</code>...</p>
<pre><code>la $a0, giveb
li $v0, 4

li $v0, 5
syscall
sw $v0, b
</code></pre>
<p>Our words are stored in memory, we have both of them, so let's put them into
our registers so we can use them in a math operation. The first loads the value
at <code>a</code> into <code>$a0</code>, the second loading the value at <code>b</code> into <code>$a1</code>.</p>
<pre><code>lw $a0, a
lw $a1, b
</code></pre>
<p>So, we have both of our integers (<em>words</em>) in our registers. If you remember,
I said that we can only do math on the values currently in the registers. 
The <code>add</code> instruction stores the results of the last 2 arguments,
into the first. For <code>add x y z</code>, <code>x</code> will store the results of <code>y + z</code>.</p>
<pre><code>add $a0, $a0, $a1
</code></pre>
<p>And now that we have our math, we'll be using the print integer service, which
is syscall #1. It prints the current integer stored at <code>$a0</code> which we
cleverly already stored the results in from the last operation. This is is
where I find assembly programming to most enjoyable, slight little improvements
in your code like that.</p>
<pre><code>li $v0, 1 
syscall
</code></pre>
<p>And then, for the farewell, the good old system call saying we've had no
issues and time to exit.</p>
<pre><code>li $v0, 10
syscall
</code></pre>
<h2 id="source_1">Source</h2>
<pre><code>.data
    a:.word 0
    b:.word 0
    givea: .asciiz "A:"
    giveb: .asciiz "B:"

.text
    # Read integer a
    la $a0, givea #Load string
    li $v0, 4     #Set syscall to print string
    syscall

    li $v0, 5    #read integer service. Integer returned in $v0
    syscall
    sw $v0, a    #store our integer into the memory location a.

    # Read integer b
    la $a0, giveb
    li $v0, 4

    li $v0, 5   #read integer service.
    syscall
    sw $v0, b   #store our integer into the memory location b.

    lw $a0, a
    lw $a1, b

    add $a0, $a0, $a1 #arg0 = arg1+arg2

    li $v0, 1 #print integer service, it prints the integer stored at register $a0
    syscall

    #exit   
    li $v0, 10
    syscall
</code></pre>
<h2 id="wrap-up_1">Wrap-up</h2>
<p>Often times we need to get used to moving data around by storing them in
memory with instructions like <code>sw</code> and math instructions will store
a register with the sum of two registers.</p>
<h1 id="part-3-echo">Part 3: Echo</h1>
<p>Get input from user, then repeat it.
This program will demonstrate allocation of memory and storing strings.</p>
<h2 id="walking-through-it_1">Walking through it.</h2>
<p>This time, we won't bother declaring in variables using <code>.data</code>, and just go
straight to the instructions in <code>.text</code></p>
<pre><code>.text
</code></pre>
<p>Before we can take a string input, we need to make sure there is a place for it
in memory. That is to say, we will be <em>allocating</em>. We'll be doing something
akin to <code>malloc</code> in C or C++. We'll be using the sbrk system service. It'll
declare a number of bytes and returns its address so that we can store and use
variables in that spot. It will store <code>$a0</code> number of bytes, and returns its
address in <code>$v0</code>.</p>
<pre><code>li $a0, 400
li $v0, 9
syscall
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we'll be using the read string service. It'll store at the address stored
in <code>$a0</code> and it will only read up to a specific number of bytes, <code>$a1</code>
number of bytes. We need to make sure it doesn't read more bytes than we know
are allocated, otherwise we'll overflow and write to memory we shouldn't be.
Now, so the first step is to move the address of the data we allocated to
<code>$a0</code> so our read string instruction will read to it. To move from register
to register with <code>la</code>, we need to use a () syntax. This is because
frequently, there'll be an offset from that. For now though, we don't have to
worry about that.</p>
<pre><code>la $a0, ($v0)
</code></pre>
<p>Okay, and now let's set the limit on the number of bytes we will read...</p>
<pre><code>li $a1, 400
</code></pre>
<p>Now, if you remember, our memory allocation service only takes two arguments,
in <code>$a0</code> and in <code>$a1</code>, abd we've already loaded our address in <code>$a0</code> and
the limit on bytes to read in <code>$a1</code>, so now let's make the call.</p>
<pre><code>syscall
</code></pre>
<p>Now generally, we would have copied the address into memory using <code>sw</code>, and
in other architectures/other implementations, that address would have been lost
if we didn't make a copy elsewhere before we made that last call. MARS is more
forgiving, however. So, the location of our string is still stored at <code>$a0</code>.
And if you remember, our print string argument reads the string at the address
stored at... <code>$a0</code>... So our print string argument is already set, we just
need to specify the service.</p>
<pre><code>li $v0, 4
</code></pre>
<p>And then, print that string.</p>
<pre><code>syscall
</code></pre>
<p>And then like always, we need to exit our program, so let's do that.</p>
<pre><code>li $v0, 10
syscall
</code></pre>
<h2 id="source_2">Source</h2>
<pre><code>.text
    li $a0, 500   #allocate 400 bytes
    li $v0, 9     #set syscall to allocate memory
    syscall

    la $a0,($v0) #set the target address for the read string 
    li $a1, 500   #set max number of chars to read 
    li $v0, 8     #set syscall to read string
    syscall

    li $v0,4     #set syscall to print string
    syscall

    li $v0,10    #exit cleanly with EXIT_SUCCESS
    syscall
</code></pre>
<h2 id="wrap-up_2">Wrap-up</h2>
<p>To allocate a large amount of data, we have to allocate it by using a system
service, and then it will give us the location of where it allocated the
memory where we will then print it.</p>
<h1 id="part-4-a-b">Part 4: A == B</h1>
<p>Get two integers from the user, state if they're equal or not.</p>
<h2 id="walking-through-it_2">Walking through it</h2>
<p>So, if you've done the Part 2, A+B, then the beginning of this part should
look pretty familiar. First, let's declare spots in memory for our data.</p>
<pre><code>.data
    a:      .word 0
    b:      .word 0
    givea:  .asciiz "Integer A:"
    giveb:  .asciiz "Integer B:"
    neqstr: .asciiz "Integers not equal.\n"
    eqstr:  .asciiz "Integers are equal.\n"
</code></pre>
<p>Let's read our first integer A, this is pretty much copy-pasted from Part 2.</p>
<pre><code>.text
    # Read integer a
    la $a0, givea
    li $v0, 4
    syscall
    li $v0, 5
    syscall
    sw $v0, a
</code></pre>
<p>Let's get the second integer B, this one is going to be slightly different from
last time. First, let's get our integer B.</p>
<pre><code>la $a0, giveb
li $v0, 4
syscall

li $v0, 5   #read integer service.
syscall
</code></pre>
<p>Our integer B is in <code>$v0</code>, last time we stored it in memory. This time we
wont'. But we still need to do our comparison operation, and have to do it on
our registers, so let's load A.</p>
<pre><code>lw $a0, a
</code></pre>
<p>And now, we need to compare the values. At the low-level, we need to use
<em>branching</em>. To do branching, we will make a comparison, and then depending
on that result, either: Jump to a specified label or: nothing. In this case,
we will use <code>beq</code>, given two arguments, it will jump to a label if its two
register arguments are equal. Otherwise, nothing happens. Let's call this label
<code>equals</code>.</p>
<pre><code>beq $a0, $v0, equals
</code></pre>
<p>We haven't actually made our <code>equals</code> label yet, between the <code>equals</code> label
and that last line, we need to put our code we want to execute, that is, the if
they're not equal. Since both equals and not equals cases will print, we don't
need to put it in our not equals section, so all we need to do between our
<code>equals</code> section and right here, is to load the string and jump to our
procedure for print and exit. We have the <code>j</code> instruction that will always
go to a specific label.</p>
<pre><code>la $a0, neqstr
j printandexit
</code></pre>
<p>Okay, now, we have our not equals, so let's make our equals section. We'll
first need a label. You'll notice this is the same syntax as when we mark spots
in memory for our data, this is no coincidence, since instructions are in
memory just like our data.</p>
<pre><code>equals:
</code></pre>
<p>And then, let's do our similar procedure for equals.</p>
<pre><code>la $a0, eqstr
j printandexit
</code></pre>
<p>Let's make our final procedure, printandexit. We will print whatever string is
in <code>$a0</code>, which we would've already dealt with loading.</p>
<pre><code>printandexit:
    li $v0, 4
    syscall
    li $v0, 10
    syscall
</code></pre>
<h2 id="source_3">Source</h2>

<h2 id="wrap-up_3">Wrap-up</h2>
<p>Branching and jump instructions are fundamental to only conditionally executing
code. Now, there is a special type of branching instruction that will let us
have true procedures, those that can have recursion, but here it's not
necessary. Forgetting jump or branch instructions before your sections can lead
to code blocks you don't want executing. Be careful.</p>
