I am currently a student at University of Washington - Tacoma campus.

My interests in programming, while varied, tend to focus on low-level code and
thinking. This has led me to really enjoy writing in C/C++ and assembly. 

However, I certainly enjoy writing software that is useful to others. This has
led me to write many projects that were either useful to me and/or would be of
use to others.

This site has both web app implementations of some of my projects, posts 
detailing their creation and much more.

I am fairly active on my GitHub, so be sure to check it out!
